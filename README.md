# What is this?
This is where I'll be collecting resources related to the Study Group on Dr. Justin Thaler's [Proofs
Arguments And Zero Knowledge
Book](https://people.cs.georgetown.edu/jthaler/ProofsArgsAndZK.pdf). The notes
posted here will be copied out of my personal Obsidian note client; certain
features like image and latex embedding will not render on Github, though should
still be readable. If you would like to read them with latex rendering, a
hack solution might be to copy them to a HackMD document. 

The group open to everyone, and runs out of the [ZK hack discord
server](https://www.zkhack.dev/) by myself and the nice folks at the Zero Knowledge
Podcast.

Have a nice repo of your own? I'd love to link to it!
