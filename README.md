# What is this?
This is where I'll be collecting resources related to the Study Group on Justin Thaler's [Proofs
Arguments And Zero Knowledge
Book](https://people.cs.georgetown.edu/jthaler/ProofsArgsAndZK.pdf).

The group open to everyone, and runs out of the [ZK hack discord
server](https://www.zkhack.dev/) by myself and the nice folks at the Zero Knowledge
Podcast.

Have a nice repo of your own? I'd love to link to it!
Questions about this resource? DM me on Twitter, @cryptograthor.
