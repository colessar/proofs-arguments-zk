# Sumcheck, in Rust and Python

## To run python tests:
```
$ pytest python/sumcheck.py
```
Note to self: I want to also try the nosetest and unittest testing frameworks in Python, but this seems pretty ergonomic; any function starting with the word "test_" gets interpretted as a test. Can also group tests into a class starting with the word "Test". Deets: https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/

## To run Rust tests:
(unfinished)
```
# cargo test
```
Still hammering out an off by one bug somewhere
